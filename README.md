`fInspect` is a file metadata database system written in [Go](http://golang.org).
It is currently work-in-progress alpha and is not recommended for use yet.

Project Goals
-------------
The `fInspect` project has the following project goals:

 1. Define a file metadata format that can be used with indexing services, metadata management systems, file manager applications and organization etc...

 2. To build a complete distributed desktop and mobile application that demostrates the various uses of having such a universal file metadata format.

The file metadata format will not be considered stable until fInspect 1.0 is released.

Building
========
Coming soon.

Documentation
